# TODO

This is an web app i'm trying to create using solely ReactJS. I'm trying to create a todo list for myself that will keep track/score me every time I finish a task. I'm also implementing a weather app inside it because that is also helpful to me using Open Weather API.

Building the Weather portion first.
